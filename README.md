# messages-json-generator

Generate messages.json files for webextensions from the HTML within.

Looks for every html attribute with an `id` and places it into a
`.json` file called `messages.ex.json`. Tidy it up a little and it's
makes it easier to localize webextensions. More docs to come, it's 1:30.
